# Portfolio.
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills and projects. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and modern CSS properties, and it is designed to be responsive across different devices.
### Key Features:
- Clean and minimalist design
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Custom CSS properties for styling

This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, where I learned and implemented several new CSS techniques. Through this, I enhanced my skills in modern web design, focusing on layout, styling, and responsive design. I also explored new CSS properties to make the website visually appealing and functional.

Feel free to explore, and let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback!
